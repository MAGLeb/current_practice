## Project description (Classification, ROC curve, TPR, FPR, PR curve, Threshold, Upsampling, Downsampling)
Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out it’s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones.<br>

We need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. I have the data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank.<br>

Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1.
